## QUICK REFERENCE

### Key Numbers:
- Target market: 1,000+ firms (Phase 1)
- Pilot goal: 25-50 customers (Month 6)
- Revenue target: $15K MRR ($180K ARR)
- Budget: $120K-160K Year 1
- Timeline: 12 weeks MVP, 6 months to 50 customers
- Pricing: $299 pilot → $399-899 launch

### My 30-Second Pitch:
"We automatically read planning commission agendas, extract opportunities, find contact info, rank by fit to each client's business, and deliver via email and portal with one-tap actions. Construction contractors get a 72-hour head start on every opportunity. Targeting Las Vegas and Utah first, aiming for 50 customers at $299-399/month within six months. I need a technical partner with Africa-based dev team. Interested?"

### Dave's Likely Top 3 Questions:
1. **"Will contractors pay for this?"**
   → Pain is real, ROI obvious (1 job = 5 years), proven demand from CM

2. **"What if everyone subscribes?"**
   → Personalization = private advantage, workflow integration = speed, time compression

3. **"Can my Africa team build this?"**
   → Yes—scraping is their strength, AI is well-documented, portal is standard stack

### My Non-Negotiables:
- I retain 70%+ ownership
- I have final say on product vision
- Clear vesting (4 years, 1-year cliff)
- 6-month validation with go/no-go criteria
- Ability to bring in specialists later

### Red Flags from Dave:
- 🚩 Wants >35% equity without matching contribution
- 🚩 Wants equal decision-making but won't commit time
- 🚩 Vague about team capacity/feasibility
- 🚩 Only focuses on risks, not opportunities
- 🚩 Indefinite "let me think about it"

### Green Lights from Dave:
- ✅ Smart customer/market questions
- ✅ Proposes product improvements
- ✅ Commits to timeline and milestones
- ✅ Talks "we" and "our customers"
- ✅ Wants to start soon (urgency)

## MINDSET GOING IN

**I am confident:** I've done the work. This is a real business.

**I am open:** Dave's perspective matters. I'll listen and adapt.

**I am decisive:** I'll make decisions in the meeting, not defer everything.

**I am flexible:** I'll negotiate on structure, but know my non-negotiables.

**I am pragmatic:** If Dave says no, I have other options. One path, not the only path.

**I am excited:** I'm building something valuable. That energy matters.

---

## FINAL THOUGHT

This business works whether Dave is in or out. He's a great potential partner, but not the only way forward.

If Dave says YES → Strong partner, fast path to market  
If Dave says NO → I'll find another way (Jeff, external team, etc.)

Either way, I'm not stuck. I'm gathering information to make the next decision.

**Time to have a great conversation. Trust my instincts. Make smart decisions. Build something valuable.**
