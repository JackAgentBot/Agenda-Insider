# MASTER SUMMARY: Planning Agenda Biz
**Unified Strategic Document for Dave Mineer Meeting**

*Synthesized from three AI strategic analyses: Claude (partnership & execution), ChatGPT (decision framework), and Grok (operational details)*

## PART 1: THE BUSINESS IN ONE PAGE

### What We're Building

An **AI-powered intelligence service** that transforms public planning commission agendas into actionable business opportunities for construction professionals.

**Not:** A report service or data dump  
**Is:** An AI deal scout that lives in their workflow—finds opportunities, ranks by fit, provides contacts, and pre-writes outreach

### The Core Value Proposition

We give dirt contractors and GCs a **72-hour head start** on every opportunity by:
1. **Automatically ingesting** planning agendas from target jurisdictions (weekly/daily)
2. **Extracting key entities** (owners, developers, engineers, architects, GCs) using AI
3. **Finding contact information** (phone, email, LinkedIn) from public and enriched sources
4. **Ranking opportunities by fit** to each client's specific business (past projects, sweet spot, capacity)
5. **Delivering actionable intel** via email brief + web portal with one-tap actions (call, email, calendar)
6. **Learning from behavior** to improve recommendations over time

### Why This Beats "Just Reading Agendas"

**The Manual Way (Current State):**
- Contractor spends 6-8 hours/week reading agenda PDFs
- Manually Googles entity names for contact info
- Writes outreach emails from scratch
- Misses 60%+ of opportunities (sporadic checking)
- Everyone does this (no competitive advantage)

**The Plan Way (Our Solution):**
- AI reads every agenda automatically (never miss anything)
- Entities and contacts extracted and enriched (zero manual work)
- Ranked by fit to YOUR business (not generic)
- Pre-written personalized outreach (in your voice, one-tap send)
- One-tap actions: call, email, add to calendar
- **Result: 72-hour head start, zero cognitive load**

### The "Secret Sauce" Story (For Skeptical Executives)

**Question:** "If everyone subscribes, isn't the advantage gone?"

**Answer (Three-Part):**

1. **Same data ≠ same action**
   - We compress time from "agenda published" to "owner called" from 5-7 days to <24 hours
   - Competitor: reads agenda → Googles contacts → writes email → calls days later
   - Plan subscriber: gets alert → taps "call with script" → connects in 2 minutes

2. **Personalization creates private advantages**
   - Your fit scores are different than your competitor's (based on YOUR past projects)
   - Your relationship history surfaces unique opportunities (AI knows you worked with this engineer before)
   - The system learns YOUR sweet spot, not a generic profile

3. **We integrate into workflow = consistency advantage**
   - Competitor checks portal when they remember (sporadic, misses opportunities)
   - Plan subscriber: automatic morning brief + calendar reminders + follow-up automation
   - They NEVER miss an opportunity; competitor misses 60%+

**Closing Line:**  
*"Think of it this way: everyone can buy a gym membership, but only some people get in shape. We're not just giving you the gym—we're giving you a personal trainer who lives in your phone, knows exactly what workout you need each day, and literally books your appointments."*

## PART 2: MARKET & PILOT STRATEGY

### Phase 1 Target Markets (Validated & Ready)

**Geography:**
- **Nevada:** Las Vegas Valley / Clark County (Planning Commission, Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas, Unincorporated Clark)
- **Utah:** Wasatch Front (Salt Lake County, Utah County, Provo, Lehi, Spanish Fork, St. George, others)

**Why These Markets:**
- High development activity (Top 12 US growth regions)
- You and Dave have existing relationships and knowledge
- Concentrated contractor base (easier to reach)
- Proven demand from your Construction Monitor history

### Target Customer Profile (ICP)

**Primary (Phase 1):**
- **Dirt contractors:** Excavation, grading, site work (10-50 employees, $5M-$30M revenue)
- **General contractors:** Commercial, multifamily, mixed-use (20-100 employees, $10M-$50M revenue)

**Secondary (Phase 2):**
- Developers (small-to-midsize, active in 2-10 projects/year)
- Civil engineers (firms looking for new project pipeline)
- Specialty trades (utilities, concrete, framing)

**Characteristics:**
- Currently reading agendas manually (or not at all)
- Missing opportunities due to time constraints
- Value speed and relationships
- Willing to pay for competitive advantage
- Decision-maker is owner, VP, or business development lead

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
- **Curate (FiscalNote):** Policy-focused, enterprise pricing ($5K+ ARR), not construction-specific
- **Construction Monitor:** Permit-level only (doesn't cover planning stage yet)
- **Manual agenda reading:** Our true competition (free but time-consuming)

**Our Differentiation:**
1. **Earlier than permits** (planning stage = more lead time)
2. **Construction-specific** (tags for grading, utilities, not generic policy)
3. **Actionable intel** (contacts + scripts + calendar, not just data)
4. **Self-serve pricing** ($99-$899/mo vs $5K+ enterprise)
5. **Personalized ranking** (fit score per client, not one-size-fits-all)

### Pilot Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Goals (6 months):**
- **Customer acquisition:** 25-50 paying subscribers
- **Revenue target:** $15K MRR ($180K ARR run rate)
- **Engagement metrics:**
  - Email open rate: >80%
  - Portal login rate: >60% monthly active users
  - Contact actions taken: >40% (calling, emailing, calendaring)
- **Business validation:**
  - 1-2 Plan-sourced wins per customer by Month 6
  - NPS (Net Promoter Score): >50
  - Churn: <10% monthly

**Go/No-Go Decision Point:**
- **Green light:** 25+ customers with strong engagement by Month 6 → continue to Phase 3
- **Pivot point:** 15-24 customers with mixed engagement → adjust pricing/features/ICP
- **Kill switch:** <15 customers or >20% churn → return capital, shut down or major pivot

## PART 4: THE CRITICAL JEFF VS. DAVE'S AFRICA TEAM DECISION

### The Three Options (Detailed Analysis)

#### **Option A: Hire Jeff as Partner/CTO**

**Jeff's Proposed Role:**
- Lead AI architecture and prompt engineering
- Entity extraction and personalization algorithms
- Advanced features (behavioral learning, predictive scoring)
- Technical strategy and infrastructure decisions

**Equity Structure (from Grok):**
- Jeff: 24% equity (vesting to 32% on tech milestones)
- Milestones: 94% AI accuracy (vest 4%), full automation (vest 4%)
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff

**Pros:**
- Deep AI expertise specifically for this type of pipeline
- Can move fast on "future-is-today" features (personalization, voice, etc.)
- Acts as ongoing brain of the system
- Potentially equity-based compensation (lower cash burn)

**Cons:**
- Significant commitment (20-30% equity is substantial)
- Single point of failure (dependency on one person)
- May limit flexibility if you want to pivot approach
- Takes bandwidth to manage/coordinate
- Risk if relationship doesn't work out (firing/breakup complexity)

**Best for:** If you need a true co-founder/CTO who owns the technical vision long-term

**Hybrid Option (Jeff Light):**
- Jeff consults on AI architecture and prompt design (10 hours/week)
- Africa team handles implementation of his designs
- Jeff gets 10-15% equity (vs 24-32%) for strategic role
- Reduces dependency while keeping AI expertise available

---

#### **Option B: Dave's Africa Team (RECOMMENDED)**

**Africa Team's Proposed Role:**
- Web scraping and data collection (core strength)
- Database design and infrastructure
- Entity extraction implementation (following AI best practices)
- Web portal development (React/Node.js)
- Email automation system
- Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes

**Cost Structure (from Grok):**
- Africa team rate: $25-40/hour
- MVP build: 500-800 hours = $12.5K-40K total
- Monthly maintenance: 40-80 hours = $1K-4K/month
- Infrastructure (AWS, tools): $200-500/month

**Dave's Role:**
- Manages Africa team (daily liaison)
- Quality assurance and spot-checking
- Product requirements and priority setting
- Construction Monitor integration (if beneficial)
- Strategic partner with deep industry knowledge

**Pros:**
- Dave already has infrastructure and team in place
- Lower cost than US developers ($25-40/hr vs $100-200/hr)
- Dave manages them (you don't need to)
- Built-in redundancy (team vs. individual)
- Easier to scale up/down based on needs
- Dave has vested interest in success (existing business relationship)
- Can start immediately if Dave agrees
- Dave brings Construction Monitor wisdom and calibration

**Cons:**
- Time zone challenges (coordination, real-time troubleshooting)
- May be more "general dev" than specialized AI product builders
- Learning curve on construction industry context (though Dave mitigates)
- Communication overhead with offshore team
- Less direct control over day-to-day technical decisions

**Best for:** If you want speed to market, lower risk, and flexibility to validate business model before big commitments

---

#### **Option C: Hybrid Approach (MOST FLEXIBLE)**

**How It Would Work:**

**Africa Team Owns (70% of work):**
- All web scraping and data normalization
- Database and infrastructure
- Web portal shell and admin tools
- Email delivery system
- Basic entity extraction (following proven patterns)

**Jeff Owns (20% of work, Strategic):**
- AI prompt architecture and templates
- Personalization algorithms
- Behavioral learning systems
- Advanced AI features (voice, predictive scoring)
- Quality assurance on AI outputs

**You + Dave Own (10% of work, Leadership):**
- Product vision and roadmap
- Customer experience design
- Pricing and go-to-market
- Sales and pilot management

**Cost Structure:**
- Africa team: $12.5K-25K for MVP (50% discount due to Dave's equity)
- Jeff: 10-15% equity for part-time strategic AI work
- Your time: CEO/sales/vision (38% equity)
- Dave's time: Product/ops/Africa liaison (38% equity)

**Pros:**
- Leverages each party's unique strengths
- Spreads risk (not dependent on any single person/team)
- Jeff can be part-time/strategic (not full operations)
- Africa team handles heavy lifting (scraping, portal, infrastructure)
- Flexibility to adjust mix over time as needs change
- Maintains optionality (can bring Jeff in deeper later if needed)

**Cons:**
- Coordination complexity (three-party communication)
- Needs clearly written scopes and ownership boundaries
- Potential for confusion over responsibilities
- May cost more than pure outsource (paying both Jeff equity + Africa cash)

**Best for:** If you want specialized AI expertise (Jeff) plus proven execution capacity (Africa team) with maximum flexibility

---

### RECOMMENDATION: Start with Option B, Keep Option C Available

**My Strategic Reasoning:**

**1. Speed to Market Matters Most Right Now**
- You need 25-50 pilot subscribers ASAP to validate the business model
- Dave's Africa team can likely start immediately (existing infrastructure)
- Jeff as co-founder adds 4-8 weeks of alignment/contracting time
- Building takes 12 weeks regardless—faster to start with known team

**2. Lower Initial Risk**
- No long-term 24-32% equity commitment to Jeff until model is proven
- Dave's Africa team is more variable cost (can scale down if needed)
- If it doesn't work, easier to pivot or shut down without complicated co-founder breakup
- Total cash outlay: $12.5K-40K (vs $60K-100K for US developers or Jeff's equity value)

**3. Dave Has Skin in the Game**
- He's already your business partner and brings Construction Monitor expertise
- His team's success = your success (aligned incentives)
- He understands construction/development industry context deeply
- He'll be motivated to make this work (affects his business reputation)

**4. Africa Team CAN Build This (With Guidance)**
- Web scraping is their core strength (proven capability)
- Entity extraction using LLMs is well-documented (OpenAI API, Claude API)
- Web portal is standard React/Node.js stack (not exotic)
- Email automation is mature technology (SendGrid, Mailchimp)
- The AI isn't rocket science for MVP:
  - Phase 1 = extraction and basic ranking (straightforward prompts)
  - Phase 2 = behavioral learning (where Jeff could come in)

**5. Jeff Stays in Your Back Pocket**
- Once you have 25-50 paying customers and proven demand, then bring Jeff in as:
  - Technical advisor (consult on advanced AI features)
  - Specialized contractor (complex personalization, voice features)
  - Future CTO hire (once you have $15K+ MRR to justify equity)
- Starting with Africa team doesn't burn the Jeff bridge
- Actually makes Jeff more valuable: "We need you for Phase 2 advanced features"

**6. Optionality and Learning**
- After 3-6 months with Africa team, you'll know:
  - If the business model works (most critical unknown)
  - If Africa team can scale with you (execution quality)
  - Where you need specialized help (AI? UX? Infrastructure?)
  - What customers actually want (may be different than you think)
- THEN make informed decision:
  - Keep Africa team + promote from within
  - Bring Jeff in for specialized AI work (hybrid)
  - Hire different specialist based on learned needs

## PART 5: PARTNERSHIP STRUCTURE & FINANCIAL MODEL

### Ownership Structure (Three Scenarios)

#### **Scenario A: Dave as Service Provider (Simplest)**

**Ownership:**
- You: 100%
- Dave: 0% (vendor only)

**Economics:**
- You pay Africa team market or near-market rates ($25-50/hr)
- Dave earns service revenue only (no equity)
- You cover all infrastructure and overhead
- When profitable, you keep 100% of profit

**When this works:**
- You want to retain full ownership
- You just need execution capacity (not strategic partnership)
- Dave doesn't want equity risk
- Relationship is purely transactional

**Downside:**
- Dave has no long-term incentive beyond billable hours
- No alignment on scaling and growth
- You lose Dave's strategic input and network
- Harder to get priority attention from his team

---

#### **Scenario B: Dave as Operating Partner (RECOMMENDED)**

**Ownership:**
- You: 70-80%
- Dave: 20-30%
- (Jeff: 0% initially, or 10-15% if hybrid)

**How Dave Earns Equity:**
1. Delivers MVP with Africa team at 50% below market rate
   - Market value: $30K-40K → You pay $15K-20K
   - Dave defers his markup/management fee (takes equity instead)
2. Manages Africa team ongoing for first 12 months
3. Contributes strategic input (Construction Monitor expertise, industry knowledge)
4. Helps recruit initial customers (leverages his network)

**Vesting Structure:**
- 4-year vesting schedule
- 1-year cliff (protects both if it doesn't work out)
- Monthly vesting after cliff

**Roles:**
- **You (CEO, 75%):**
  - Product vision and strategy
  - Customer experience design
  - Sales and marketing
  - Fundraising (if needed)
  - Customer success
- **Dave (CTO/COO, 25%):**
  - Technical architecture oversight
  - Africa team management
  - Quality assurance
  - Infrastructure and DevOps
  - Construction Monitor integration

**Economics:**
- Africa team discounted rate: $15K-20K for MVP (vs $30K-40K market)
- Your cash outlay: ~$18K-23K total (includes infrastructure)
- Monthly ongoing: $1K-2K for maintenance + $500 infrastructure
- When revenue comes:
  - Subtract COGS (Africa team, infrastructure, tools)
  - Subtract salaries (once affordable)
  - Remaining profit splits 75/25
  - More likely Year 1: Reinvest all profit into growth

**Example Math (Month 6):**
```
Revenue: $20K/mo (50 customers × $400 avg)
- Africa team: $2K/mo
- Infrastructure: $500/mo  
- Marketing/tools: $1K/mo
- Reserve/reinvest: $16.5K/mo

If taking profit (unlikely Year 1):
- You (75%): $12,375/mo
- Dave (25%): $4,125/mo

More realistic (reinvest):
- Hire salesperson: $5K/mo
- Add 2 jurisdictions: $1K/mo
- Marketing budget: $3K/mo
- Reserve for runway: $7.5K/mo
```

**Why This Structure is Recommended:**
- Fair to both parties (you're the visionary, Dave is key enabler)
- Meaningful upside for Dave (incentivizes excellence, not just hours)
- Market-standard for founder + technical partner
- Keeps decision-making clear (you lead, Dave supports)
- Scales well (can raise funding later without over-dilution)
- Strong alignment: Dave wins big if you win big

---

#### **Scenario C: Dave as Co-Founder (Highest Commitment)**

**Ownership:**
- You: 50-60%
- Dave: 40-50%

**How This Works:**
- Equal or near-equal partners in decision-making
- Africa team at cost (no markup, Dave's equity is full compensation)
- Dave may contribute cash ($10K-25K) to match your investment
- Both take salaries once business can afford ($80K-120K each)

**When this works:**
- You see Dave as equal visionary partner (not just technical enabler)
- You want shared risk and shared reward
- You value his skills/network as equally critical as yours
- You're building for big outcome (acquisition, major scale)

**Why NOT Recommended Here:**
- You're the visionary and industry expert (product DNA comes from your Construction Monitor experience)
- Dave is critical but enabling role (execution, not vision)
- 50/50 creates decision gridlock (who has final say?)
- Over-dilutes you given you're driving sales, strategy, and customer experience

---

**Final Proposal:**
- **You: 75% ownership**
  - CEO/Founder
  - Product vision and customer experience
  - Sales, marketing, and pilot execution
  - Cash investment: $18K-23K over 6 months

  - Contributes via discounted team rates (foregoes $15K-20K in markup)
  - Vesting: 4 years, 1-year cliff
- **Jeff (Optional Hybrid): 10-15% ownership**
  - Strategic AI advisor
  - Part-time (10 hours/week)
  - Advanced features architecture
  - Vesting: 4 years, 1-year cliff

**Decision Rights:**

| **Decision Type** | **Who Decides** | **Input From** |
|-------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Product strategy & roadmap | You (final say) | Dave (technical feasibility) |
| Customer pricing & packaging | You (final say) | Dave (cost inputs) |
| Technical architecture | Dave (final say) | You (product requirements) |
| Africa team management | Dave (final say) | You (if affects delivery) |
| Major pivots or shut-down | Both (unanimous) | - |
| Fundraising terms | You (final say) | Dave (review) |
| New market expansion | Both (consensus) | - |

### Sales Process (15-Minute Demo Model)

**Step 1: Outreach (Email or LinkedIn)**
Subject: "How [Company Name] can get 72-hour head start on every planning opportunity in [Region]"

Body (3 sentences):
- "I noticed you're active in [Las Vegas/Utah] construction. We've built an AI tool that reads every planning agenda and sends you a ranked list of opportunities that match your business—with owner contacts and call scripts ready to go."
- "Early users are calling owners 3-7 days before their competitors even see the agenda."
- "Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this week?"

**Step 2: Demo Call (15-20 minutes)**
- Show them a REAL weekly brief (mocked up for their specific profile and past projects)
- Walk through portal (live demo with actual data from their market)
- Explain ROI: "If you win ONE job from our intel, it pays for 5+ years of service"
- Offer: "Join pilot at $299/mo, cancel anytime. If you stay through the pilot, you're locked in at this price forever."

**Step 3: Onboarding (If Yes)**
- Send onboarding survey: Recent 5 projects, ideal future projects, regions, types, typical margins
- Set up account and configure first brief
- Send welcome email: "Your first brief arrives Monday at 6 AM"
- Calendar intro call for Week 1

**Step 4: Engagement Loop**
- **Week 1:** Check-in call ("How was your first brief? Any surprises?")
- **Week 2:** Usage review ("You clicked 8 opportunities but didn't call any—what held you back?")
- **Month 1:** Deep feedback session ("What's working? What's not? What would make this indispensable?")
- **Ongoing:** Monthly check-ins, NPS surveys, win attribution tracking

### The 10 Critical Decisions (In Order)

Use this as your meeting agenda. Check off each as you align with Dave.

---

#### **DECISION 1: Are We Committed to Building This Together?** ⏱️ 10 minutes

**Question:** Is the Planning Agenda business a game we both truly want to play for the next 1-3 years?

**Dave Needs to Evaluate:**
- [ ] Does he believe in the market opportunity?
- [ ] Does he have time/bandwidth to be actively involved?
- [ ] Does he see how his team and Construction Monitor expertise add unique value?
- [ ] Is this complementary to his other businesses, or a distraction?

**You Need to Evaluate:**
- [ ] Is Dave the right partner for this (trust, chemistry, complementary skills)?
- [ ] Do you want to share ownership, or would you rather build solo?
- [ ] Are you willing to share equity/revenue with a partner?

**Outcome:**
- ✅ **YES → Proceed to Decision 2**
- ❌ **NO → Thank Dave, pivot to other options (Jeff, solo, different partner)**
- ⏸️ **MAYBE → Set deadline for final decision (1 week max)**

---

#### **DECISION 2: Partnership Structure** ⏱️ 15 minutes

**Question:** If we're doing this together, what does "together" mean?

**The Three Options:**

**Option A: Service Provider**
- Dave's Africa team as contractor/vendor
- You pay market or near-market rates
- You own 100%, Dave owns 0%
- Purely transactional relationship

**Option B: Operating Partner (RECOMMENDED)**
- You own 70-80%, Dave owns 20-30%
- Dave earns equity through:
  - Discounted Africa team rates (50% below market)
  - Strategic oversight and Construction Monitor expertise
  - Help recruiting initial customers
- 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- Clear roles: You = CEO/product/sales, Dave = CTO/ops/tech

**Option C: Co-Founder**
- 50/50 or 60/40 split
- Both actively building, shared decision-making
- Equal partnership in every sense

**Recommended Proposal to Dave:**
"I think Option B makes most sense—75% me, 25% you. Here's why fair:
- I'm the visionary and driving sales/strategy
- You're the key enabler with Africa team and Construction Monitor wisdom
- This is market-standard for founder + technical partner
- We're both incentivized: you win big if I win big
- Decision-making is clear: I lead, you support and execute
- Vesting protects us both if things change"

**Outcome:**
- ✅ **Aligned on structure → Proceed to Decision 3**
- ⚠️ **Need to negotiate → Counter-proposals (e.g., Dave wants 30%, or different vesting)**
- ❌ **Can't agree → May need to reconsider partnership or find compromise**

---

#### **DECISION 3: Technical Execution Approach** ⏱️ 15 minutes

**Question:** Who actually builds the MVP and how?

**If Dave is Service Provider (Option A):**
- Africa team does all the work
- You pay market rates ($30K-40K for MVP)
- Clear SOW with deliverables and timeline
- Simple vendor relationship

**If Dave is Operating Partner (Option B - RECOMMENDED):**
- Africa team is default build team
- Discounted rates (50% = $15K-20K for MVP)
- More collaborative, less transactional
- Dave manages them, you provide product requirements

**The Jeff Question (Nested Decision):**
- [ ] **No Jeff:** Africa team handles everything (scraping + AI + portal)
- [ ] **Jeff Hybrid:** Africa team does scraping/portal, Jeff consults on AI (10% equity)
- [ ] **Jeff Full:** Jeff leads all tech as CTO (24-32% equity)

**Recommendation:**
"Let's start with Africa team only for MVP. If we need specialized AI help for Phase 2 advanced features, we can bring Jeff in then as consultant or part-time CTO. This keeps us lean and flexible."

**Questions for Dave:**
1. "Can your Africa team handle this scope?" (Show him the MVP requirements)
2. "What's their availability? Can we start in 2 weeks?"
3. "What's your confidence level on a 12-week timeline for pilot-ready product?"
4. "Do you see any technical risks or gaps in our plan?"

**Outcome:**
- ✅ **Africa team confirmed → Proceed to Decision 4**
- ⚠️ **Africa team + Jeff hybrid → Define split and Jeff's equity (10-15%)**
- ❌ **Africa team not available/capable → Discuss alternatives (external hires, Jeff full-time)**

---

#### **DECISION 4: Roles & Responsibilities** ⏱️ 10 minutes

**Question:** Who does what, specifically?

**Proposed Division:**

**You (CEO, 75%):**
- Product vision and strategy
- Customer experience design (briefs, portal, features)
- Sales and marketing (pilot recruitment, demos, close deals)
- Customer success (onboarding, support, feedback loops)
- Fundraising (if needed in future)

**Dave (CTO/COO, 25%):**
- Technical architecture and infrastructure
- Africa team management (daily liaison, task assignment)
- Quality assurance (spot-checking data accuracy)
- Construction Monitor integration (if beneficial)
- DevOps and scaling support

**Decision Rights:**
- **Product decisions:** You lead (Dave provides technical feasibility input)
- **Technical decisions:** Dave leads (you provide product requirements)
- **Pricing/go-to-market:** You lead (Dave reviews)
- **Major pivots/shut-down:** Both unanimous
- **Hiring Africa team members:** Dave decides
- **Fundraising terms:** You lead (Dave reviews)

**Weekly Rhythm:**
- Monday: You + Dave strategy call (30 min)
- Wednesday: Dave + Africa team standup (you join if needed, 30 min)
- Friday: Progress review + next week planning (60 min)

**Outcome:**
- ✅ **Aligned on roles → Proceed to Decision 5**
- ⚠️ **Need clarification on specific areas → Document and revisit**

---

#### **DECISION 5: Timeline & Milestones** ⏱️ 10 minutes

**Question:** What do we build, when, and how do we measure success?

**Proposed Timeline:**

| **Phase** | **Weeks** | **Key Milestone** | **Success Metric** |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Phase 0: Agreement | 1-2 | Signed partnership agreement | Legal docs signed, kickoff scheduled |
| Phase 1: MVP Build | 3-14 (12 wks) | Pilot-ready product | Demo-able, you'd charge for it |
| Phase 2: Soft Launch | 15-18 (4 wks) | 10 beta users | 8/10 actively engaging |
| Phase 2: Paid Pilot | 19-22 (4 wks) | 25 paying customers | $7K MRR, strong engagement |
| Phase 2: Scale to 50 | 23-26 (4 wks) | 50 paying customers | $15K MRR, 2+ case studies |
| Phase 3: Growth | 27-52 (26 wks) | 100-200 customers | $50K-100K MRR, product-market fit |

**Go/No-Go Decision Point (Week 26 / Month 6):**
- ✅ **Green light:** 25+ customers, strong engagement, <15% churn → Continue to Phase 3, raise funding if needed
- ⚠️ **Yellow light:** 15-24 customers, mixed engagement → Pivot (adjust pricing, features, ICP), give it 3 more months
- 🛑 **Red light:** <15 customers, >20% churn, poor engagement → Shut down or major pivot, return remaining capital

**Questions for Dave:**
1. "Does this timeline feel realistic given your team's capacity?"
2. "What would cause you to want to shut down or pivot?"
3. "Are you comfortable with the 6-month validation window?"

**Outcome:**
- ✅ **Aligned on timeline → Proceed to Decision 6**
- ⚠️ **Need to adjust (e.g., Dave wants 16 weeks for MVP, not 12) → Negotiate**

---

#### **DECISION 6: Financial Structure** ⏱️ 15 minutes

**Question:** Who pays for what, and how do we split economics?

**Recommended Structure (Option B - Operating Partner):**

  - Market rate for MVP: $30K-40K
  - Discounted rate: $15K-20K
  - Foregone revenue: $15K-20K (his equity compensation)
  - Plus: Ongoing management and oversight

**Pivot Options (Ranked by Recommendation):**

**Option 1: Jeff as Co-Founder/CTO**
- Reach out immediately: "Dave passed, but I'm still building this. Want to partner?"
- Offer: 20-30% equity, 4-year vest, he owns all technical
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks to align and sign, then start building
- Pros: Deep AI expertise, motivated partner
- Cons: 20-30% equity, single point of failure

**Option 2: Hire External Dev Team**
- Research: Upwork, Toptal, Arc.dev, or agencies
- Budget: $30K-50K for MVP (market rate)
- Timeline: 2-3 weeks to hire, then 12-16 weeks to build
- Pros: Retain 100% ownership, flexibility
- Cons: Higher cash burn, more management overhead

**Option 3: Find Different Technical Partner**
- Network: YC co-founder matching, AngelList, LinkedIn

- Cons: SLOW, steep learning curve, may not be your strength

**Option 5: Shelve for Now, Revisit Later**
- If none of the above feel right, it's okay to pause
- Use the time to:
  - Validate demand more deeply (talk to 50 contractors)
  - Raise pre-seed funding to hire proper team
  - Find a different opportunity that excites you
- Revisit in 6-12 months with more resources or clarity

**Recommendation: Option 1 (Jeff) or Option 2 (External Team)**
- Both keep momentum going
- Option 1 if you want a true partner

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    PLANNING AGENDA BIZ - PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL
                             For Dave Mineer
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

THE OPPORTUNITY
• Every week, $100M+ of construction projects enter planning commissions
• Contractors spend 6-8 hours manually reading agenda PDFs—miss 60%+ of opportunities
• We transform planning agendas into actionable intelligence delivered to phones/inboxes
• Subscribers get: ranked opportunities + contact info + call scripts + calendar events

THE PRODUCT
AI Deal Scout that:
  ✓ Scrapes planning agendas automatically (weekly/daily)
  ✓ Extracts entities (owners, engineers, GCs, architects)
  ✓ Finds contact information (phone, email, LinkedIn)
  ✓ Ranks by fit to each client's specific business
  ✓ Delivers via email brief + web portal with 1-tap actions
  ✓ Learns from behavior to improve over time

THE MARKET
  Phase 1: Las Vegas + Utah (1,000+ qualified firms)
  Phase 2: Western US (10,000+ firms)
  Phase 3: National (50,000+ firms)
  Pricing: $299 pilot → $399-899/mo launch (per company, unlimited users)

THE PLAN
  Weeks 1-2: Partnership agreement, kickoff with Africa team
  Weeks 3-14: Build MVP (scraping, AI, portal, email system)
  Weeks 15-18: Beta test (10 users, free/cheap, feedback-heavy)
  Weeks 19-26: Paid pilot (50 customers, $15K MRR by Month 6)
  Month 7-12: Scale (100-200 customers, $50K-100K MRR)

THE ASK
  Partnership Structure: You 75%, Dave 25%
  
  Dave's Contribution:
  • Africa team builds MVP at 50% discount ($15K vs $30K market)
  • Manages team, oversees quality, provides Construction Monitor expertise
  • Helps recruit initial customers from network
  • Strategic partner, not just vendor
  
  Your Contribution:
  • $60K-80K cash over 12 months (in tranches tied to milestones)
  • Product vision, customer experience design, sales & marketing
  • CEO/founder role, full-time commitment
  
  Vesting: 4 years with 1-year cliff for both

YOUR UPSIDE
  If we hit $100K MRR (200 customers):
  • Your 25% = $300K/year in profit share
  
  If we sell at 5× revenue ($6M valuation at $100K MRR):
  • Your 25% = $1.5M payout
  
  Plus:
  • Africa team gets steady, interesting work
  • New revenue stream for your business
  • Portfolio diversification beyond Construction Monitor

THE "SECRET SAUCE" (Why We Win)
  1. Personalization (fit scores unique to each client, not generic)
  2. Workflow integration (lives in inbox/calendar, not dusty portal)
  3. 72-hour head start (we compress time from agenda → owner call)
  4. Actionable (contact info + scripts, not just data)
  5. Continuous learning (AI improves as clients use it)

VALIDATION
  From your Construction Monitor experience:
  • Proven demand for earlier-stage project intel
  • Clients repeatedly asked for planning commission data
  • No one does this well at scale yet
  • Construction industry is underserved by tech

SUCCESS METRICS (6 Months)
  • 50 paying customers
  • $15K MRR ($180K ARR run rate)
  • >80% email open rate, >60% portal login rate
  • 1-2 Plan-sourced wins per customer
  • <10% monthly churn

GO/NO-GO DECISION
  • ✅ Green light: 25+ customers, strong engagement → Scale to Phase 3
  • ⚠️ Yellow light: 15-24 customers → Pivot (pricing, features, ICP)
  • 🛑 Red light: <15 customers, >20% churn → Shut down, return capital

NEXT STEPS (If You're In)
  Week 1:
  • Draft and sign operating agreement
  • Schedule Africa team kickoff meeting
  • Set up shared tools (Slack, Notion, bank account)
  
  Week 2:
  • Africa team kickoff (you + me + team lead)

  Week 3:
  • Green-light build to start
  • Weekly check-ins established (Mondays, 30 min)
  • Momentum established, building begins

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
                    Ready to build the future together?
                         Let's make this happen.

### Your Mindset Going In:

**Confidence:** You've done the work. This is a real business with clear demand.

**Openness:** Dave's perspective matters. Listen and adapt.

**Decisiveness:** Make decisions in the meeting. Don't leave key questions unanswered.

**Flexibility:** Be willing to negotiate on structure, but know your non-negotiables.

**Pragmatism:** If Dave says no, you have other options. This is one path, not the only path.

**Excitement:** You're building something valuable. Let that energy come through.

---

### One Final Thought:

This business works whether Dave is in or out. He's a great potential partner because of his team, expertise, and Construction Monitor connection—but he's not the only way forward. 

If Dave says yes, you have a strong partner and fast path to market.  
If Dave says no, you'll find another way (Jeff, external team, etc.).

Either way, **you're not stuck. You're just gathering information to make the next decision.**

**Now go have a great conversation with Dave. Trust your instincts. Make smart decisions. And build something valuable.**

**You've got this.**

## APPENDIX: Quick Reference

### Key Numbers to Remember
- **Target market:** 1,000+ firms in Phase 1 (Las Vegas + Utah)
- **Pilot goal:** 25-50 customers by Month 6
- **Revenue target:** $15K MRR by Month 6 ($180K ARR run rate)
- **Budget:** $120K-160K Year 1 (split between you and Dave)
- **Timeline:** 12 weeks to MVP, 6 months to 50 customers
- **Pricing:** $299 pilot → $399-899 launch

### Your Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)
"We're building an AI-powered intelligence service for construction contractors. We automatically read planning commission agendas, extract key opportunities, find contact information for owners and developers, rank everything by fit to each client's business, and deliver it all via email and web portal with one-tap call and email actions. Subscribers get a 72-hour head start on every opportunity. We're targeting Las Vegas and Utah first, aiming for 50 paying customers at $299-399/month within six months. I'm looking for a technical partner to help build this with Africa-based dev team. Interested?"

### Dave's Likely Top 3 Questions
1. **"How do you know contractors will pay for this?"**
   - Pain is real (they all read agendas manually or miss opportunities entirely)
   - ROI is obvious (1 job won = pays for 5+ years)
   - Similar services exist (Curate, Construction Monitor) but ours is more actionable
   - Your Construction Monitor history proves demand

2. **"What if everyone subscribes and the advantage disappears?"**
   - Personalization creates private advantage (fit scores unique to each client)
   - Workflow integration = speed advantage (72-hour head start)
   - We compress time, not just provide data
   - Even if competitors have it, most won't use it consistently (human nature)

3. **"Can my Africa team actually build this?"**
   - Yes—web scraping is their core strength
   - AI is well-documented (OpenAI/Claude APIs)
   - Portal is standard React/Node.js stack
   - Phase 1 AI is straightforward (extraction and ranking)
   - Phase 2 advanced AI (behavioral learning) can be outsourced if needed

### Your Non-Negotiables
- [ ] You retain majority ownership (70%+ minimum)
- [ ] You have final say on product vision and customer experience
- [ ] Clear vesting schedule with 1-year cliff (protects both of you)
- [ ] 6-month validation window with clear go/no-go criteria
- [ ] Ability to bring in Jeff or other specialists later if needed

### Red Flags from Dave
- 🚩 Wants >35% equity without matching contribution
- 🚩 Wants equal decision-making but won't commit substantial time
- 🚩 Vague about Africa team capacity or technical feasibility
- 🚩 Focuses only on risks, not opportunities
- 🚩 "Let me think about it indefinitely" (indecision is a decision)

### Green Lights from Dave
- ✅ Asks smart questions about customers and go-to-market
- ✅ Proposes ideas to improve the product
- ✅ Commits to specific timeline and milestones
- ✅ Talks about "we" and "our customers" (ownership mentality)
- ✅ Wants to start soon (urgency signals real interest)

---

**Good luck with Dave. You're well-prepared. Trust yourself. Make great decisions. Build something valuable.**
