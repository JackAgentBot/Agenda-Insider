## ASSESSMENT: WHAT'S THE QUALITY?

### Overall Grade: B+ (Strong Foundation, Needs Execution Proof)

**Strengths:**
- Thoughtful strategic work in Q4 2025
- Extensive external research
- Master Sequence is exceptional
- Legal foundation solid
- Lead assets ready
- Jack's campaign infrastructure complete

**Weaknesses:**
- No execution proof yet (understandable - still in prep)
- Some clutter/redundancy
- Unclear product status
- No financial tracking yet
- Missing performance data

**Bottom Line:**
This repo shows a well-researched, thoughtfully planned business. What's missing is execution evidence - but that's expected given the timeline (November planning → February execution start). The foundation is strong. Now we need to build the performance tracking layer and start converting plans to results.

2. **Get Jeff's build status** - What's been built? What works? What's next?
3. **Approve folder restructure** - Archive, results, deployed, learnings
4. **Start financial tracking** - Every dollar in/out starting today
5. **Launch campaign** - Move from planning to execution
6. **Track everything** - Build the performance data layer

5. 🔲 **Build financial tracking template**
6. 🔲 **Execute campaign launch** (once Aaron provides tool access)

**Audit Completed:** Feb 12, 2026 7:15 PM UTC  
**Files Reviewed:** 83  
**Time Invested:** ~2 hours
