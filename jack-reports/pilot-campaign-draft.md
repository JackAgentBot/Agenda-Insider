## EMAIL 1: "The FOMO Hook"
**Subject:** You're missing projects your competitors already know about

**Body:**
```
{{First_Name}},

Quick question: How often do you find out about a construction project *after* your competitors have already made contact with the developer?

It happens more than you think.

Planning commissions in Utah County and Salt Lake County approved 78 new projects in January alone. Multifamily, commercial site work, mixed-use developments — $247M in total project value.

But here's the problem: By the time these projects hit public bid boards, 3-4 contractors have already had conversations with the developer.

**What if you could see these projects 3 weeks earlier?**

That's what Agenda Insider does. We turn planning commission agendas into project leads, so you can contact developers before the project goes public.

Want to see how it works? Reply to this email and I'll send you a demo link.

```

**Why This Works:**
- **FOMO:** "Your competitors already know about"
- **Specific numbers:** "78 projects, $247M" (credibility)
- **Local relevance:** Utah County + Salt Lake County
- **Timing advantage:** "3 weeks earlier"
- **Low-friction CTA:** "Reply to this email"

## EMAIL 2: "The Social Proof Hook"
**Subject:** How Brandon [Last Name] won a $2.4M project 3 weeks early

**Body:**
```
{{First_Name}},

Following up on my last email about finding projects before they go to public bid.

Here's a real example:

Brandon [Last Name], owner of [GC Company Name], saw a 180-unit apartment project in a Lehi planning commission agenda. This was 3 weeks before the developer posted a public RFP.

He reached out to the developer that same day. By the time the RFP went public, he'd already had two conversations and submitted a preliminary estimate.

He won the bid. $2.4M site work project.

**His unfair advantage? He used Agenda Insider.**

We track every planning commission meeting in Utah County and Salt Lake County. When a project gets approved, you get an alert with:

✓ Project details (size, scope, timeline)  
✓ Developer contact info  
✓ Planning commission approval date  
✓ Estimated bid timeline  

**The first 50 subscribers get 30% off for 3 months. (12 spots left.)**

Or reply with any questions — happy to walk you through it.

```

**Why This Works:**
- **Story-driven:** Real example (Brandon won $2.4M project)
- **Specificity:** "180-unit, Lehi, 3 weeks, $2.4M"
- **Feature benefits:** Bullet list shows value
- **Scarcity:** "12 spots left" (creates urgency)
- **CTA variety:** Link OR reply

**NOTE TO AARON:** Brandon example is placeholder. Replace with actual customer story if available, or remove name and use "A Utah contractor..." if no testimonial yet.

## EMAIL 3: "The Urgency Hook"
**Subject:** Last chance: 10 spots left (30% off)

**Body:**
```
{{First_Name}},

You've seen my previous two emails about Agenda Insider — the tool Utah contractors are using to find projects 3 weeks before public bids.

I wanted to follow up one last time because **we're down to the last 10 founding member spots** (30% off for 3 months).

After those are gone, the price goes back to full retail.

Here's what you get:

→ Real-time alerts when projects hit planning commissions in Utah County or Salt Lake County  
→ Developer contact info (so you can reach out first)  
→ Interactive map showing every project in your coverage area  
→ Searchable database (filter by project type, size, location)  

**The math is simple:**

If you win just ONE project from an early lead, Agenda Insider pays for itself 100× over.

Most contractors are already using this. The question is: Do you want to be ahead of them, or playing catch-up?

Or if you have questions, just reply to this email.

**Why This Works:**
- **Urgency:** "Last 10 spots left"
- **FOMO:** "Most contractors are already using this"
- **ROI framing:** "Win ONE project = 100× ROI"
- **Removes friction:** "No credit card, cancel anytime"
- **Final CTA:** Clear link + reply option
