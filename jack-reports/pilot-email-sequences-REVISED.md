## EMAIL 1 (Day 1) - Word Count: 87

**Subject:** You're losing projects to contractors who see them first

**From:** contact@tryagendainsider.com (or getagenda/useagenda)  
**To:** {{First_Name}} @ {{Company}}

**Body:**

{{First_Name}},

Quick question: how often do you find out about a project after your competitors already contacted the developer?

It's frustrating. And it happens more than you think.

**Here's why:** Planning commissions approve projects 2-3 weeks before permits go public. Most contractors wait for the permit. A few don't.

Those few are using Agenda Insider. We track every planning commission meeting in Utah County and Salt Lake County, so you know about projects before anyone else.

Want to see how it works? Just reply.

## EMAIL 2 (Day 5) - Word Count: 94

**From:** Same as Email 1  
**To:** {{First_Name}} @ {{Company}}

**Body:**

{{First_Name}},

Following up on my last email about finding projects early.

Last week, planning commissions in Utah County and Salt Lake County approved 47 new projects. Multifamily, commercial, site work — $180M total value.

**Most contractors will find out in 2-3 weeks when permits go public.**

But a few already know. Because they're using Agenda Insider.

## EMAIL 3 (Day 9) - Word Count: 82

**Subject:** This is my last email

**From:** Same as Email 1  
**To:** {{First_Name}} @ {{Company}}

**Body:**

{{First_Name}},

I've sent you two emails about Agenda Insider — the tool that shows you projects before permits go public.

I won't keep bothering you, but I wanted to follow up one last time because **you're competing against contractors who already have this intel.**

Every day you wait is another project someone else finds first.

**14-day free trial. Full access. See every project in Utah County and Salt Lake County before your competitors.**

Start now: [Link]

Or reply and I'll answer any questions.

## KEY CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS VERSION

### What Changed:
1. **Shorter:** All under 100 words (previous version: 150-200 words)
2. **Conversational:** Removed corporate language ("value proposition", "ROI", "strategic advantage")
3. **One benefit:** "Know about projects before competitors" (repeated in all 3)
4. **No Brandon story:** Removed placeholder testimonial (Aaron said "built with input from Utah contractors" is validation)
5. **Simpler CTA:** Just "reply" or link, no multiple options
6. **No fake scarcity:** Removed "10 spots left" (not true)

### What Stayed:
- FOMO hook (competitors are ahead)
- Local specificity (Utah County, Salt Lake County)
- Real numbers (47 projects, $180M) in Email 2
- 14-day free trial mention
- Multiple touchpoints across 9 days
