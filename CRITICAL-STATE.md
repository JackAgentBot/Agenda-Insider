# CRITICAL STATE — TRUE CURRENT STATE

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-14 09:00 AM MT  
**Purpose:** Jack's authoritative reference for Agenda Insider's current state

---

## THE PRODUCT

**Agenda Insider** = Live SaaS product at **agendainsider.com**

**What it does:** Monitors municipal planning commission agendas and transforms them into early-stage construction project leads. Gives customers a 6-18 month head start on projects — before permits, before bids, before competitors know the work exists.

**Three core features customers use today:**
1. **Data Explorer** - Searchable, filterable table of all planning projects (581+ projects live in Utah County + Salt Lake County)
2. **Map View** - Geographic parcel map with project pins (846+ projects plotted)
3. **Alerts** - Save searches with specific criteria, receive daily/weekly email digests ("Save This Search" = core engagement loop)

**Status:** FREE BETA. Mike and Brandon are active beta users. Product works. Data is real. **Zero paying customers yet.**

---

## THE PRICING (CONFIRMED)

- **$100/month** for first region (e.g., Utah County)
- **$50/month** for each additional region
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)
- **Cancel anytime** (no contracts)

**Examples:**
- 1 region = $100/month ($1,200/year)
- 2 regions = $150/month ($1,800/year)
- 3 regions = $200/month ($2,400/year)
- Utah + Vegas = $150/month

**CRITICAL:** Older docs reference $97 or $99. Those are WRONG. Always use $100/$50 pricing.

## CURRENT REVENUE: ZERO

## STRATEGIC GAPS & IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES

### Gaps
1. **Zero revenue** - No paying customers yet (biggest risk)
2. **Single developer** - Jeff is sole technical resource (operational risk)

### Immediate Priorities (Next 7 Days)
1. ✅ Updated CRITICAL-STATE.md (this document)
2. Extract 200 pilot contacts from HBA Excel files
3. Verify Instantly.ai warming status (need API access fix or manual check from Aaron)
4. Draft cold email copy (problem/solution, 60 words max, "Quick question" subject line)
5. Convert beta users (Mike, Brandon) to paid plans
6. Build first industry-specific landing page (electricians or excavation contractors)

### Next 30 Days
1. Launch pilot email campaign (200 contacts, 3 domains)
2. First 5-10 paying customers
3. Google Ads campaign (test $200 budget)
4. HBA partnership outreach (attend chapter meeting, offer member benefit)
5. Referral program design

### Next 90 Days
1. 25+ paying customers
2. Scale to full HBA lists (1,500-2,000 contacts)
3. Add 8 remaining domains to Instantly.ai
4. Launch Clark County, Nevada expansion (second market)
5. Content marketing (blog, LinkedIn, case studies)
