# BEHIND THE SCENES: Why These Questions Work

## Psychological Design Principles

### 1. **Start with Victory (Questions 3-4)**
- Asking about "best recent projects" triggers positive memories
- People LOVE talking about their wins
- Creates dopamine hit early in questionnaire (increases completion rate)
- Frames the questionnaire as "helping you get more of what you love" not "interrogation"

### 2. **Make It Feel Like Bragging, Not Reporting**
- "Your crown jewel" vs "Project #1"
- "Who do you love working with?" vs "List your clients"
- "Your dream project" vs "Ideal project parameters"
- Language matters—make them feel like a badass, not a data entry clerk

### 3. **Memory-Based Questions Only**
- No one needs to look anything up
- No "what was your revenue in 2023?" questions
- Everything is answerable from memory in the moment
- Reduces friction, increases completion

### 4. **Progressive Disclosure**
- Start easy (name, company)
- Build to more thoughtful (dream project, vision)
- End easy (communication preferences)
- Avoids overwhelming them upfront

### 5. **Give Examples and Context**
- "Example: 180-unit apartment complex"
- Shows them what kind of answer we're looking for
- Reduces cognitive load

### 6. **Make It About THEM, Not Us**
- "Let's find you MORE jobs like your best ones"
- "Where are you taking this business?"
- "What would make this a home run for YOU?"
- Every section is framed as being FOR their benefit

### 7. **Show Immediate Value**
- Explain WHY we're asking each question
- "💡 Why we ask: When we see these names in planning agendas, you'll get instant alerts"
- They understand the value exchange

### 8. **Create Anticipation**
- "You're about to gain an unfair advantage"
- "Think of these questions as a chance to brag"
- "Welcome to your unfair advantage"
- Excitement-building language throughout

### 9. **Remove Decision Fatigue**
- Multiple choice whenever possible
- Checkboxes, not free-form text (except where stories matter)
- Pre-populated ranges for $ values
- Makes it FAST

### 10. **Vision Questions Build Emotional Investment**
- "Your dream project"
- "Where are you taking this business?"
- When they articulate their vision, they mentally commit to using the tool to achieve it

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data We're Actually Collecting:

**For Personalization:**
- Company name, type, capabilities (feeds into fit scoring)
- Past successful projects (teaches AI what "good" looks like)
- Preferred developers/engineers (instant alert triggers)
- Ideal project size, location, capacity (filters universe)

**For AI Training:**
- What made projects "great" (teaches AI what to prioritize)
- Dream project description (reveals unspoken preferences)
- Growth goals (helps us understand risk tolerance, ambition level)
- Success metrics (what they're optimizing for)

**For Delivery:**
- Team members and roles (who gets what alerts)
- Communication preferences (text/email, frequency, threshold)
- Contact info (obvious but critical)

**For Engagement:**
- How they heard about us (tracks marketing effectiveness)
- What would make this a "home run" (success criteria we can measure against)

### Completion Rate Optimization:

**Target: 85%+ completion rate**

**Tactics:**
1. **Progress bar at top** (shows "62% complete" to encourage finishing)
2. **Auto-save** (if they abandon, we can email "finish your setup in 30 seconds")
3. **Mobile-optimized** (50%+ will fill this out on their phone)
4. **Skip options** (for team members, preferences—nothing is truly "required" except basics)
5. **Estimated time shown** (3 minutes—sets expectation, creates commitment)

### Post-Submission Flow:

**Immediate (automated):**
1. Thank you page with "What happens next" timeline
2. Confirmation email with portal link and credentials
3. Welcome video from founder (optional, 90 seconds)
4. Calendar invite for optional "Quick Start" call (30 min, 48 hours out)

**Within 24 hours (automated + human):**
1. First AI-generated brief (even if it's "Here's what we're analyzing for you...")
2. Success manager introduction email
3. If they added team members, those welcome emails go out

**Within 48 hours (human touch):**
1. Success manager calls/texts: "Got your setup info, anything I can clarify?"
2. If they haven't logged into portal yet: "Your first alerts are ready—want me to walk you through?"

**Within 7 days (automated):**
1. First macro intelligence report
2. "How are we doing so far?" check-in email
3. If zero engagement: "Having trouble? Let's hop on a quick call"

### A/B Testing Opportunities:

**Test these variations:**
1. "Brag about your wins" vs "Tell us about your business" (headline framing)
2. 3 past projects vs 5 past projects (detail vs speed)
3. Dream project as free-form text vs multiple choice (quality vs friction)
4. Show ROI promise upfront vs end (motivation timing)
5. Video explainer at top vs text only (engagement vs distraction)

### Red Flags to Watch For:

**If someone answers like this, flag for follow-up:**
- Selects "10+ projects" capacity but is solo operator (unrealistic expectations)
- Dream project is way outside their past project range (need to recalibrate expectations)
- Selects "90+ fit score only" but has narrow capabilities (won't get enough alerts)
- Doesn't add any team members but selected "7-10 people" (needs help with setup)
- Leaves "dream project" blank (may not be serious subscriber)

### Integration Points:

**This data feeds into:**
1. **AI fit scoring algorithm** (project history + preferences → personalized scores)
2. **Email/SMS delivery system** (preferences → routing)
3. **CRM** (company profile, team structure, success metrics)
4. **Billing system** (company name, primary contact, payment method)
5. **Success dashboard** (track engagement against stated goals)

---
