## TOOLS TO AVOID (Waste of Money)

❌ **Most CRMs** - You have HubSpot, don't add another  
❌ **Generic enrichment tools** - Clay replaces most of them  
❌ **Social media schedulers** - Not relevant for B2B cold email  
❌ **SEO tools** - Not conversion-focused right now  
❌ **Most "AI writing assistants"** - Claude/GPT do this better

### What If We Only Hit 2% Conversion?

- Year 1 ARR: $46,560
- **ROI: 79x in Year 1**

**Bottom line:** Even at HALF target, this prints money.
