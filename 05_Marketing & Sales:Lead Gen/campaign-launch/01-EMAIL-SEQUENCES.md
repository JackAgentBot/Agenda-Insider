## SEQUENCE 1: Construction Executive (Owners/GCs)

### Email 1 - Day 0 (Personalized Intro + Value Hook)
**Subject:** Quick planning idea for [Company]

Hi [FirstName],

I noticed [Company] is active in [County] development. We help Utah contractors like [similar company] stay ahead on upcoming projects before bids close.

Quick question: How do you currently track planning agendas and early-stage opportunities in your pipeline?

We've built an AI tool that monitors county planning meetings and surfaces projects 30-60 days before they hit public bid sites. 

Worth a 10-minute demo?

### Email 2 - Day 3 (Social Proof + Case Study)
**Subject:** [Company] - following up on planning intelligence

[FirstName],

Following up on my note about early project intelligence.

**Quick result:** One of our Utah GCs used our system to identify 3 major projects in West Jordan before they hit public bidding. Won 2 of them because they got in early with the developer.

The tool pays for itself if it helps you catch just one project per quarter that you'd otherwise miss.

Can I send over a 2-page sample of current Salt Lake County planning activity?

### Email 3 - Day 7 (Breakup + Last Value)
**Subject:** Last note - one planning tip for [Company]

[FirstName],

I'll stop bothering you after this one!

**One quick tip:** Most contractors miss that Davis County posts planning agendas 48 hours earlier than Salt Lake. If you're working that region, set a calendar reminder for Wednesday mornings.

If you ever want to see how our AI tool automates this across 12 counties, just reply "show me" and I'll send a quick video.

Otherwise, best of luck with your upcoming projects.

P.S. We're offering Utah HBA members a 60-day trial (normally 30 days) through February.

## SEQUENCE 2: Project Manager / Superintendent (Tactical)

### Email 1 - Day 0
**Subject:** Staying ahead on [County] planning - quick tool

[FirstName],

Quick question: Do you track planning commission agendas for early pipeline intel?

We built a tool for Utah PMs that monitors county planning meetings and flags relevant projects before they hit public bid boards.

**Example:** Got a client into a $2.3M West Valley mixed-use project 45 days before the RFP went public. They were the only qualified bidder.

Worth 10 minutes to see if it helps your pipeline?

### Email 2 - Day 3
**Subject:** [Company] - sample planning intelligence

[FirstName],

Following up on planning agenda monitoring.

Attaching a **sample of this week's hot projects** from Salt Lake and Utah counties - this is what our tool surfaces automatically.

Most PMs we work with say they find 2-3 qualified leads per month that they'd otherwise miss.

Want to try it for 60 days? (On us for HBA members through Feb.)

— Jack

---

### Email 3 - Day 7
**Subject:** No worries - one resource for [FirstName]

[FirstName],

No problem if now's not the right time.

**Free resource:** I put together a quick list of the top 5 Utah county planning portals that update fastest. Want me to send it over?

Otherwise, feel free to reach out anytime if early project intelligence becomes a priority.

— Jack

## SEQUENCE 3: Follow-Up (Engaged but No Response)

### Email 4 - Day 14 (Re-engagement)
**Subject:** [Company] + planning intelligence - checking back in

[FirstName],

Circling back - any interest in seeing how other Utah contractors are using planning commission data for early pipeline development?

**New feature:** We just added integration with Dodge reports so you can cross-reference planning activity with upcoming bid opportunities.

Quick call this week?

— Jack

---

### Email 5 - Day 30 (Long-term nurture)
**Subject:** Utah construction outlook - Feb 2026

[FirstName],

Sharing some intel we're seeing across Utah counties:

- **Davis County:** 23 residential projects in planning pipeline (up 40% vs. Jan)
- **Washington County (St. George):** Major commercial uptick - 8 mixed-use projects incoming
- **Salt Lake County:** Slower month, but 2 large infrastructure bids expected in March

If you want automated alerts for your target project types, our tool can filter by size, location, and project category.

Let me know if you'd like a demo.

## Email Best Practices (From Strategy Docs)

### ✅ DO:
- Keep subject lines under 50 characters
- Personalize with company name, county, or recent trigger
- Lead with value/curiosity, not product pitch
- Single clear CTA per email
- Add P.S. with time-sensitive offer or tip
- Use plain text (or minimal HTML) for better deliverability

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use spam trigger words: "free", "guarantee", "act now", "limited time"
- Send attachments in first email (links to hosted docs only)
- Write paragraphs longer than 3 lines
- Use excessive formatting or images
- Send on weekends (worst open rates in B2B)
