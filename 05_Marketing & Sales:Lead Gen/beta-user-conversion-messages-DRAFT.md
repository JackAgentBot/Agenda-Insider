# Beta User Conversion Messages — DRAFT FOR AARON'S REVIEW

**Date**: February 14, 2026  
**Target**: Mike and Brandon (existing beta users)  
**Goal**: Convert to paying customers ($100/month)  
**Status**: **AWAITING AARON'S APPROVAL — DO NOT SEND**

---

## Context

Mike and Brandon are active beta users. They've been using Agenda Insider for free and see value in it. The transition from "free beta" to "$100/month paid" is the first proof of business model. Aaron has the relationship — these messages are drafts for his review and editing.

---

## OPTION 1: Simple Direct Ask

**Best for**: Mike and Brandon both, if Aaron's relationship is strong

**Message**:

> Hey [Mike/Brandon],
> 
> Quick update — we're officially launching Agenda Insider out of beta. $100/month for Utah County (or Salt Lake County), $50/month for additional regions. 14-day free trial to start, cancel anytime.
> 
> You've been using it free during beta. Want to keep going with the paid plan? If it's been valuable, I'd love to have you as a customer. If not, no hard feelings — your feedback alone has been huge.
> 
> Let me know either way?
> 
> Aaron

**Why this works**: 
- Simple, direct, no pressure
- Acknowledges their beta contribution
- Gives them an easy out if they don't want to pay
- Aaron's voice, not salesy

## OPTION 2: Value Reinforcement (If They Need a Reminder)

**Best for**: If Mike or Brandon haven't logged in recently or haven't talked about value

**Message**:

> Hey [Mike/Brandon],
> 
> Wanted to check in — have you been using Agenda Insider over the last few weeks? We're launching the paid version ($100/month, 14-day trial) and I wanted to make sure you're still getting value before I switch your account over.
> 
> Quick reminder of what you have access to:
> - 581+ projects across Utah County + Salt Lake County
> - Planning stage intel (2-18 months before permits)
> - Map view + Data Explorer + email alerts
> 
> If you've been using it and it's been helpful, I'd love to keep you on as a paying customer. If not, totally understand — your beta feedback has been incredibly valuable either way.
> 
> Worth keeping?
> 
> Aaron

**Why this works**:
- Reactivates them if they've been dormant
- Reminds them of specific value they're getting
- Still gives them an easy out

## OPTION 3: Soft Trial Extension (If They're Hesitant)

**Best for**: If Mike or Brandon respond with "I'm not sure" or "That's more than I expected"

**Follow-up message** (only if they hesitate):

> No pressure. Tell you what — I'll give you another 30 days free to really test it out. Use it hard. See if you find a project that pays for itself. If it does, we're good. If not, we part as friends.
> 
> Fair?

**Why this works**:
- Removes price objection temporarily
- Puts the value test on them ("find one project that pays for itself")
- Creates obligation (they got extra free time, feels fair to reciprocate if value is proven)

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AARON

1. **Start with Option 1** (Simple Direct Ask) for both Mike and Brandon. Your relationship is strong, they're already users, and simplicity is better than over-explaining.

2. **If they don't respond within 48 hours**, send a follow-up:
   > "Hey [Name], checking if my last message got buried. No rush, just let me know if you want to stick with Agenda Insider at $100/month or if you're good wrapping up the beta."

3. **If they say "I need to think about it"**, use Option 3 (Soft Trial Extension) to give them 30 more days.

4. **If they say "That's too expensive"**, pivot:
   > "Fair. What price would work for you? I'm flexible for early customers who've been testing with us."
   
   This opens negotiation. If they say $50, consider it — first paying customer is worth more than holding the line at $100.

5. **If they say "I haven't been using it much"**, use Option 2 (Value Reinforcement) to re-engage them before asking for money.

## TIMING

**Best time to send**: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11 AM Mountain Time (when contractors are at their desk, not in the field)

**Aaron's call**: You know Mike and Brandon's schedules better than I do. Send when they're most likely to engage.

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- **Best outcome**: Both Mike and Brandon say "Yes, sign me up" → First 2 paying customers = $200 MRR = proof of business model
- **Good outcome**: One says yes, one says "give me 30 more days" → 1 paying customer + 1 warm lead
- **Acceptable outcome**: Both ask for 30-day extension → They're still engaged, just need more time to see value
- **Learning outcome**: Both say "Not worth $100/month" → We learn pricing is too high or value prop needs adjustment

## JACK'S NOTE TO AARON

These are templates. Edit them in your voice. You know Mike and Brandon better than I do — adjust tone, add personal context, reference specific conversations you've had. The key is: keep it simple, acknowledge their beta contribution, and give them an easy yes or easy no.

If you want me to draft custom messages based on more context about Mike and Brandon (what they've said, what they do, why they signed up for beta), send me those details and I'll revise.

**DO NOT SEND THESE UNTIL AARON APPROVES.**

**Status**: Awaiting Aaron's review and edits.
