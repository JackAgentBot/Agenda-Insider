**Target Audience**: Excavators and GCs actively hunting for new work  
**Value Prop**: 72-hour head start on new projects  
**Hook**: Early intel = first-mover advantage  

### Email Variant A1 (Primary)

**Subject**: Quick question

**Body** (54 words):

[First Name],

Quick question: what if you saw the 50-unit subdivision in Vineyard 3 months before the permit was pulled?

Agenda Insider scrapes planning commission agendas across Utah County + Salt Lake County. You'll know about projects while they're still in design review — before your competitors even hear the rumor.

14-day free trial. $100/month, cancel anytime.

Worth a look?

### Email Variant A2 (Alternate)

**Subject**: Quick question

**Body** (58 words):

[First Name],

Random question: how much earlier do you need to see projects to win more bids?

Most dirt guys find out when the permit hits Dodge — 6 months late. Agenda Insider shows you planning commission agendas the week they're published. Lock in equipment and subs while competitors are still driving around looking for orange flags.

$100/month, cancel anytime.

### Email Variant B1 (Primary)

**Subject**: Quick question

**Body** (59 words):

[First Name],

Quick question: do you know which competitor just got a rezoning approved on the lot next to your current project?

You're locked in for the next year. Agenda Insider monitors the 5-mile radius around your active site for competitor activity, drainage changes, and city council surprises that could affect your job.

### Email Variant B2 (Alternate)

**Subject**: Quick question

**Body** (56 words):

[First Name],

You're heads-down on a project right now. Fair assumption?

Agenda Insider is the radar you keep running while you're in the cab. Free trial, $100/month, cancel anytime.

## FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCE (Same for Both Tracks)

### Follow-Up 1 (3 days after initial email — if no reply)

**Subject**: Re: Quick question

**Body** (42 words):

[First Name],

Following up — did you get a chance to look?

581 projects live in the system right now (Utah County + Salt Lake County). Planning stage, not permit stage. Free trial is 14 days, no credit card required.

Let me know if you want a quick walkthrough.

### Follow-Up 2 (7 days after initial email — if no reply)

**Subject**: Last one, I promise

**Body** (38 words):

[First Name],

Last email, I promise.

One question: if you could see every planning commission agenda in Utah County the day it's published, would that change how you bid?

If yes, here's the link: [agendainsiderapp.com/excavation]

## A/B TEST DESIGN

### Split

- **Track A (Hunting)**: 100 contacts (50 excavators randomly selected, 50 GCs randomly selected)
- **Track B (Defense/Sentinel)**: 100 contacts (remaining 50 excavators, remaining 50 GCs)

### Metrics to Track

| Metric | Track A Target | Track B Target | Winner Indicator |
|--------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| **Open Rate** | >30% | >30% | Which subject line performs better |
| **Reply Rate** | >8% | >8% | Which message resonates more |
| **Trial Signups** | >5% (5+ trials) | >5% (5+ trials) | Which drives more action |
| **Paid Conversions** | >2% (2+ paying) | >2% (2+ paying) | **CRITICAL: Which converts to revenue** |

### Decision Rule

After 14 days:
- **If Track A wins on paid conversions**: Scale with hunting message (early intel, first-mover advantage)
- **If Track B wins on paid conversions**: Scale with defense message (market radar, territory protection)
- **If both perform similarly**: Test hybrid message combining both angles

## PERSONALIZATION VARIABLES

### Dynamic Fields (via Instantly.ai or Smartlead)

- `{{firstName}}` — First name (extracted from contact list or company name)
- `{{company}}` — Company name
- `{{city}}` — City from address (used in B2: "Want 5-mile visibility around [City]?")

### Manual Enrichment (If Time Allows)

For excavators specifically, check if they have an active project visible on agendainsider.com Map. If yes, reference it in Track B:

> "You're locked in on [Project Name] in [City] right now. Do you know which competitor just got approved on the lot next door?"

This level of personalization could dramatically increase reply rates but is labor-intensive. Test with first 20 excavators only.
