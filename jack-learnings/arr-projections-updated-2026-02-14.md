## YEAR 1 GROWTH TRAJECTORY (Conservative Model)

Assuming we start with 0 subscribers in March 2026 and ramp up over 12 months:

| Month | New Subs | Churn | Net Subs | MRR | ARR (Run Rate) |
|-------|----------|-------|----------|-----|----------------|
| **Mar 2026** | 5 | 0 | 5 | $570 | $6,840 |
| **Apr 2026** | 10 | 0 | 15 | $1,710 | $20,520 |
| **May 2026** | 15 | 1 | 29 | $3,306 | $39,672 |
| **Jun 2026** | 20 | 1 | 48 | $5,472 | $65,664 |
| **Jul 2026** | 25 | 2 | 71 | $8,094 | $97,128 |
| **Aug 2026** | 30 | 2 | 99 | $11,286 | $135,432 |
| **Sep 2026** | 35 | 3 | 131 | $14,934 | $179,208 |
| **Oct 2026** | 40 | 3 | 168 | $19,152 | $229,824 |
| **Nov 2026** | 45 | 4 | 209 | $23,826 | $285,912 |

| **Jan 2027** | 55 | 5 | 304 | $34,656 | $415,872 |
| **Feb 2027** | 60 | 6 | 358 | $40,812 | $489,744 |

**Year 1 Exit Run Rate**: ~$490K ARR (358 subscribers at blended $114 ARPU)  
**Churn Assumption**: 2% monthly (industry standard for B2B SaaS)

## ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS

### Assumptions
1. **TAM Accuracy**: Estimated 9,000-15,000 businesses based on web research + industry directories
2. **Conversion Rate**: 4% is aggressive but achievable with multi-channel marketing (Cody Schneider's playbook)
3. **Pricing**: $50-200/mo is competitive vs national players charging $300-1,500/mo
4. **Churn**: 2% monthly = 24% annual churn (B2B SaaS average)
5. **Sales Velocity**: Linear growth ramping from 5 to 60 new subs per month over Year 1

### Risks
1. **Market Saturation**: If TAM is overestimated, ceiling is lower
2. **Price Sensitivity**: Real estate agents and smaller trades may balk at $50-100/mo
3. **Value Perception**: If pre-permit intel doesn't convert to won projects, churn will spike
4. **Competition**: Dodge, ConstructConnect, BuildCentral could undercut pricing
5. **Execution**: Multi-channel marketing (ads, cold email, content) requires significant time/budget investment

## COMPARISON TO COMPETITORS

| Competitor | Price | TAM | Est. ARR | Market Position |
|------------|-------|-----|----------|-----------------|
| **Dodge Construction Network** | $500-1,500/mo | National (100K+ businesses) | $50M+ | Enterprise leader |
| **ConstructConnect** | $300-800/mo | National (50K+ businesses) | $20M+ | Commercial focus |
| **BuildCentral** | $150-300/mo | Utah (1K businesses) | $1.8M (10% penetration) | Regional player |
| **BidClerk** | $99-199/mo | National (50K+ businesses) | $10M+ | Post-permit focus |
| **Agenda Insider (NEW)** | $50-200/mo | Utah/SLC (9K-15K businesses) | $410K-684K (4% conversion) | Pre-permit niche |

**Our Competitive Edge**: 
- Lower price than all competitors except BidClerk
- Pre-permit intelligence (earlier than anyone else)
- Hyper-local focus (Utah/SLC—know the market better)

## WHAT THIS MEANS FOR AARON

**Old Strategy**: Sell to 300 general contractors in Utah County  
- Best case: 12 subscribers × $100/mo = $1,200 MRR ($14,400 ARR)
- You'd need 83% conversion to hit $25K ARR
- Realistically: $7,200-14,400 ARR ceiling

**New Strategy**: Sell to 9,000+ construction-adjacent businesses in Utah + Salt Lake Counties  
- Best case: 360 subscribers × $114 blended ARPU = $34,200 MRR ($410,400 ARR)
- At 4% conversion, you hit $400K+ ARR
- Market leader position (10% conversion): $1M+ ARR

**Bottom Line**: Expanding the TAM 30x increases the ARR ceiling by 30x. Instead of a $15K ARR lifestyle business, you're building a $400K-1M+ ARR venture-backable SaaS.

## NEXT ACTIONS

1. **Update Website Messaging**: Stop saying "for general contractors"—say "for construction professionals" or "for the construction industry"
2. **Build Industry-Specific Landing Pages**: Electricians, plumbers, real estate agents, architects, material suppliers
3. **Segment Apollo Lead Lists**: Create separate lists for each Tier (Tier 1 = primary trades, Tier 3 = real estate/finance, etc.)
4. **Test Multi-Tier Pricing**: Launch Basic ($50), Pro ($100), Premium ($200) tiers
5. **Multi-Channel Campaign**: Google/Facebook Ads with customer match lists (start with $200 test budget)
6. **Partnership Strategy**: Approach AGC Utah, Salt Lake HBA, Utah Realtors for association partnerships

**Timeline**: 
- Week 1 (Feb 14-21): Update website, build landing pages
- Week 2 (Feb 21-28): Launch multi-tier pricing, segment lead lists
- Week 3 (Feb 28-Mar 7): Test multi-channel ads, begin outreach to Tier 1
- Week 4 (Mar 7-14): Analyze results, iterate messaging, scale what works

**Expected Outcome**: If we execute on TAM expansion + multi-channel marketing, we should see 5-10 new subscribers in March 2026 (vs 0-2 under old strategy). That's the signal that the new model works.
