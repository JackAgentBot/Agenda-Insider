# Cold Email Competitive Research - BLOCKED

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED - No Brave Search API Key  
**Researcher:** Jack + Sub-Agent

---

## BLOCKER

**Issue:** Both Jack and spawned sub-agent cannot access web_search tool  
**Reason:** No Brave Search API key configured in OpenClaw  
**Impact:** Cannot research recent cold email campaigns in construction industry  

**Error Message:**
```
web_search needs a Brave Search API key. 
Run `openclaw configure --section web` to store it, 
or set BRAVE_API_KEY in the Gateway environment.
```

## WORKAROUND OPTIONS

### Option 1: Aaron Configures Brave API Key (RECOMMENDED)
1. Get Brave Search API key: https://brave.com/search/api/
2. Run: `openclaw configure --section web`
3. Or set environment variable: `BRAVE_API_KEY=xxx`
4. Jack will immediately run research

### Option 2: Aaron Does Manual Research

- Review case studies on Smartlead/Instantly/Lemlist sites
- Ask in sales communities (Pavilion, Sales Enablement)

## JACK'S ASSESSMENT (Based on Existing Research)

### Tool Recommendations (From Feb 12 Stack Analysis)

**Top Tier:**
1. **Instantly.ai** or **Smartlead** - Most used for cold email in 2025-26
2. **Clay** - AI personalization at scale
3. **GlockApps** - Deliverability monitoring
4. **Calendly** - Meeting booking

**Why These?**
- Instantly/Smartlead: Industry standard, proven at scale
- Clay: Emerged as personalization leader in 2025
- Most successful campaigns now use AI personalization

### Expected Conversion Rates (Conservative)

Based on general B2B best practices:
- **Open rate:** 20-30% (construction may be lower - busy audience)
- **Reply rate:** 2-5% (personalized vs. generic)
- **Meeting rate:** 0.5-2% (depends on offer quality)
- **Trial conversion:** 0.5-1% (of total sent)
- **Paid conversion:** 3-5% (of trials)

**For our 2,000 contacts:**
- 500-600 opens
- 40-100 replies
- 10-40 meetings
- 10-20 trials
- 4-10 paid subscribers

**Our 4% target (80 subscribers from 2,000) is achievable but aggressive.**

## DECISION: PROCEED WITHOUT RESEARCH?

**Jack's Recommendation:**

**YES - Proceed with recommended stack even without competitive research.**

**Why:**
1. Master Sequence document already contains extensive research
2. Recommended tools (Smartlead/Instantly, Clay) are industry consensus
3. Waiting for research delays campaign launch
4. We can pivot quickly if early results underperform

**BUT:**
- Set up Brave API key for ongoing competitive monitoring
- Research should be continuous, not one-time
- Monitor what competitors are doing monthly

---

## ALTERNATIVE RESEARCH JACK CAN DO NOW

Without web search, Jack can:

1. **Read all PDFs in AI sales team creation folder**
   - Extract key insights
   - Summarize best practices
   - Compile into comprehensive learnings doc

2. **Analyze Master Sequence more deeply**
   - Already reviewed, but can extract more specifics
   - Create implementation checklist

3. **LinkedIn manual search** (if Jack had browser access)
   - Search for construction sales leaders
   - Review their posts about email campaigns
   - Find case studies in posts

**Which alternative should Jack pursue?**

---

## NEXT STEPS

**For Aaron:**
1. Get Brave Search API key (free tier available)
2. Configure in OpenClaw: `openclaw configure --section web`
3. Tell Jack to re-run competitive research

**Or:**
1. Approve proceeding without research
2. Jack uses existing knowledge + repo PDFs
3. Set up web search for ongoing monitoring

**For Jack:**
1. ⏳ Wait for web search access OR approval to proceed
2. 📖 Read all research PDFs in repo (can do now)
3. ✅ Complete other tasks (repo audit ✅, dashboard ✅)

---

**Status:** Waiting on Aaron's decision  
**Blocker:** Technical (Brave API key)  
**Impact:** Medium (can work around, but research would be valuable)  
**ETA to Unblock:** When Aaron provides API key or approves proceeding
