- **Tier 3 (Real Estate/Finance)**: Large TAM but lower price sensitivity—test $50-75/mo tier
- **Tier 4 (Design Professionals)**: High-value, consultative sales approach

### 2. Build Industry-Specific Landing Pages

- Landing page for plumbers: "Get ahead of your competition with pre-permit project alerts"
- Landing page for real estate agents: "Know about new developments before they're listed"

### 5. Partner with Industry Associations

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Current Strategy**: Targeting ~300 general contractors in Utah County  
**New Strategy**: Targeting ~9,000-15,000 construction-adjacent businesses in Utah + Salt Lake Counties

**Old TAM**: 300 businesses × 4% conversion = 12 subscribers × $100/mo = **$1,200 MRR**  
**New TAM**: 9,000 businesses × 4% conversion = 360 subscribers × $100/mo = **$36,000 MRR**

**That's a 30x increase in addressable market.**

We've been fishing in a pond when there's an ocean next door.

## Next Steps (This Week)
1. Update website copy to speak to ALL construction-adjacent industries, not just contractors
2. Create 5 industry-specific landing pages (electricians, plumbers, real estate agents, architects, material suppliers)
3. Build separate lead lists in Apollo for each Tier (start with Tier 1)
4. A/B test email campaigns by industry: "for electricians" vs "for contractors" messaging
5. Update financial model with new TAM and conversion projections

**Expected Impact**: If we execute on this expansion, we go from a $14,400 ARR ceiling (current TAM) to a $430,800-720,000 ARR opportunity at 4% conversion.
