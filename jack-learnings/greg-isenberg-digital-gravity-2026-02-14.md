## Core Concept: Digital Gravity
Forget linear funnels. Build "digital mass" through continuous content and omnichannel presence so customers orbit your brand until they convert. Marketing is not a campaign with start/end—it's an always-on system.

## The B2B Playbook (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Identify & Scrape Target Audience
- **Tool**: Apollo.io ($99/month for 10K emails)
- Focus on niche audience (~50,000 people)
- Scrape emails from LinkedIn, directories
- **What We Do**: We already use Apollo for lead scraping. Validate we're pulling the RIGHT 50K—not just general contractors, but ALL construction-adjacent industries (see target market expansion below).

### 2. Multi-Channel Advertising (Customer Match Lists)
- Upload scraped emails to Google Ads, Facebook Ads, LinkedIn Ads
- Run UGC AI avatar ads continuously (not campaigns)
- **Tools**: HeyGen (AI avatars), ElevenLabs (AI voiceovers)
- Create dozens of ad variations (different hooks, pain points, settings)
- **Budget Split**: 80% to best performers (lowest CPC), 20% to testing
- **What We Do**: We're NOT running coordinated multi-channel ads yet. This is a GAP. We should test Google/Facebook customer match lists with our Apollo scraped emails. Start with $200 test budget.

### 3. Cold Email at Scale
- **Tools**: MailReef ($400/month for 50K emails on AWS), Smartlead, or Instantly AI ($89/month)
- Create multiple inboxes using DIFFERENT DOMAINS (not main domain)
- **Domain Isolation Strategy**: Separate domains for (1) transactional, (2) marketing/newsletter, (3) cold emails
- Focus on problem/solution approach, mirror ad messaging
- Don't fear "burning" the audience—focus on value
- **What We Do**: We use Smartlead. Currently warming 3 domains (agendainsidernews.com, agendainsidernow.com, agendaintel.com). VALIDATE we have proper domain isolation and are following this playbook. Are our cold emails mirroring consistent messaging across channels? NO. Fix this.

### 4. Content Creation (Podcast as Media Arm)
- Record customer conversations → create industry-specific podcast
- Send podcast to scraped email list (Mailerlite, Beehive, SendGrid)
- Build media arm to increase leverage in industry
- **Monetization**: Sell ad placements—turn cost center into profit center
- **What We Do**: We do NOT have a podcast. This is a major gap for building authority. Consider starting "The Pre-Permit Podcast"—interview contractors about projects they won because of early intel. Record, repurpose, distribute.

### 5. Content Repurposing
- **Tool**: Swell AI (Cody's company—extracts pain points, creates transcripts, blog posts, white papers from audio/video)
- Repurpose content across LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok
- Schedule and publish where customers spend time
- Run Instagram-only ads with CTA to follow the account
- **What We Do**: We're not repurposing at scale. If we start a podcast, we MUST use Swell AI or similar to extract 10+ assets from every episode.

### 6. Email Marketing Best Practices
- **Critical**: Use separate domains for transactional, marketing, and cold emails
- This prevents main domain from being flagged for spam
- **What We Do**: Check our current setup. Are BidList.com and AgendaInsider.com protected? Are we sending cold emails from throwaway domains only?

## Key Metrics to Track
- **CPC (Cost Per Click)**: Aim for <$1 on ads
- **CPM (Cost Per Thousand Impressions)**: Keep <$10
- **Deliverability Rate**: Monitor email bounce and spam rates
- **Open Rate**: Track across all campaigns
- **Reply Rate**: Measure engagement quality
- **Conversion Rate**: Trials → Subscribers

## What We're Missing (Immediate Actions)
1. **Multi-channel ad strategy**: Not running coordinated Google/Facebook/LinkedIn ads with customer match lists
2. **Podcast/media arm**: Zero content authority being built
3. **Content repurposing engine**: Not extracting 10x value from single content pieces
4. **Monetization path**: No plan to turn marketing into profit center (ads, sponsorships)
5. **Domain isolation audit**: Verify we're protecting main domains

## What We're Doing Right
1. Using Apollo for lead scraping
2. Using Smartlead for cold email at scale
3. Warming multiple domains

## Next Steps (This Week)
1. Audit domain isolation strategy—document which domains are used for what
2. Test customer match list ads on Google/Facebook with $200 budget
3. Research podcast feasibility: can we interview 1 contractor per week about projects they won?
4. Evaluate Swell AI or alternatives for content repurposing
5. Calculate ROI if we turned Agenda Insider into a media company (ad revenue potential)

---
**Bottom Line**: Cody Schneider's playbook is about building an always-on marketing machine, not running campaigns. We have pieces of this (Apollo, Smartlead) but we're missing the orchestration—multi-channel ads, content authority (podcast), and repurposing at scale. The companies winning at B2B SaaS subscriptions are doing ALL of this simultaneously. We're doing 30%. That's the gap.
